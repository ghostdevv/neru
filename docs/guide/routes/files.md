# Route Files

In Neru a route is a JavaScript (or TypeScript!) file that exports [route handlers](/guide/routes/handlers).

## File Names and Structure

Named files and directories are used to build a route, an index file will correspond to a `/`. For example:

![file name to route mapping](/file-tree.png)
